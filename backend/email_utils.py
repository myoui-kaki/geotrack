"""
email_utils.py - Real email delivery for GeoTrack's notification module.

Reads SMTP credentials from environment variables so the same code works
locally (where SMTP usually isn't configured) and on Railway (where it is):

    SMTP_HOST        e.g. smtp.gmail.com
    SMTP_PORT        e.g. 587
    SMTP_USER        the mailbox to send from
    SMTP_PASSWORD    an app password (NOT the account password, for Gmail)
    SMTP_FROM_NAME   display name, defaults to "GeoTrack - LSPU-SPCC"

If SMTP_HOST/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASSWORD aren't set, send_email() logs a note
and returns False instead of raising -- a missing mail configuration should
never take down an unrelated request (registration, flagging, an SOS
alert, etc). Every call site treats the return value as best-effort.
